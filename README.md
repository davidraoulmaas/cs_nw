# SQL Test dbt Project

## Introduction+

This is my attempt on the dbt case study. About 6 hours were invested, with no prior operational knowledge on dbt.

A lot of ideas, enhancements or even duties were left open:
- [ ] Incremental loading of (at least) campaign facts
- [ ] Further testing, especially concluding unit tests
- [ ] Further analysis scripts or other reporting preparation
- [ ] Further normalization of the tables: cases, opportunities
- [ ] Completeness of final included fields in all tables
